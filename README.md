# Front-end Mac setup
Setting up a new mac? Use these steps and it will be done for you :)
Just fork the repo, and in the brewfile uncomment or add software so its suits your needs.

## Steps:

Install your new macbook without too much Hassel*hoff.*

1. Install Brew in your terminal:
    `$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
1. Run homebrew bundle to install everything thats in the brewfile
    `$ brew bundle --file {Location of file the brewfile of this repo}`
1. Optionally check the  additional config for more setup

In the additional part I run the autoupdater for Brew, this way all your software stays up-to-date!
